## Modules

* Will be using the resource name and resource group name to reference the resource in a module, because
    * It helps reduce the dependency on the id, which are long and difficult to maintain. Also, therefore accommodates
      any resources created from the Azure dashboard.
    * It will improve the maintainability of the modules as the outputs required will not change based on the other
      modules dependent on the given module's resource(s).

## Naming Convention

* The resources have been named in the following convention
    * Primary Resources

      `<resource_abbreviation>-<app_name>-<environemnt>-<shortened_resource_location>-<random-8-letter-string>`

        * This random 8 letter string is defined inside the 'utility/random-identifier'
    * Secondary resources in module

      `<primary_resource_abbreviation>-<secondary_resource_abbreviation>-<app_name>-<environemnt>-<shortened_resource_location>-<random-8-letter-string>`

* The resource location has been shortened to three digits using the following criteria

  `{uaenorth: uan, uaecentral: uac}`
